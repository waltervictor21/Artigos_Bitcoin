That’s where Artigos Bitcoin is born—a library where anyone can read and publish their own articles about Bitcoin, all in Portuguese. If you feel grateful for the content available here and want to contribute some satoshis via Lightning, the address can be found in the footer or <a href=\"/pages/ajuda.html\" target=\"_blank\">at this link.</a> Thank you for reading."
